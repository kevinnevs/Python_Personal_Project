**_Sandwich Maker_**

Write a program that asks users for their sandwich preferences. The program should use PyInputPlus to ensure that they enter valid input, such as:

A). Using inputMenu() for a bread type: wheat, white, or sourdough.
B). Using inputMenu() for a protein type: chicken, turkey, ham, or tofu.
C). Using inputYesNo() to ask if they want cheese.
D). If so, using inputMenu() to ask for a cheese type: cheddar, Swiss, or mozzarella.
E). Using inputYesNo() to ask if they want mayo, mustard, lettuce, or tomato.
F). Using inputInt() to ask how many sandwiches they want. Make sure this number is 1 or more.
G). Come up with prices for each of these options, and have your program display a total cost after the user enters their selection.
